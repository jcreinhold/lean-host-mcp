## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Initial release of `lean-host-mcp`, an MCP server that hosts Lean 4 in a supervised worker child
  (`lean-rs-worker-parent` + `lean-rs-worker-child`) and reaches the elaborator and kernel directly rather than through
  an external LSP.
- Two-crate workspace: a parent that does **not** link `libleanshared` and a per-toolchain worker binary that does —
  keeping the parent free of the Lean dylib so one server can host multiple toolchains.
- Multi-toolchain dispatch: each Lake project resolves its own `lean-toolchain` pin to a worker binary under
  `~/.local/share/lean-host-mcp/workers/<id>/`; `install-worker` subcommand builds and installs them.
- A six-tool declaration-centric proof workflow:
  `proof_state -> search_for_proof -> inspect_declaration -> try_proof_step -> verify_declaration`, plus
  `find_references` for semantic lookup. `proof_state` degrades to `{ "status": "unsupported" }` when the optional host
  shim is absent.
- Closure-channel actor over the worker child, with a `ProjectBroker` per-project pool and idle reaper.
- Stdio (default) and loopback-only Streamable HTTP transports.
- Response envelope contract (`result` + `freshness` + optional `warnings`/`next_actions`) shared by every tool;
  Lean-domain failures are part of the `Ok` payload, not MCP errors.
- Worker RSS supervision: a post-job restart policy and an in-flight hard-kill watchdog, plus the
  `rss_threshold_sweep.py` tuning tool.
- Honest resolution verdicts: an incomplete project build degrades to a single `needs_build` verdict carrying a
  `lake build` cue across `verify_declaration`, `inspect_declaration`, `proof_state`, `try_proof_step`,
  `find_references`, and `search_for_proof` — never a misleading `ambiguous` status or a hard transport error. Genuine
  ambiguity instead names the competing declarations, and `facts_trustworthy` flags any verdict computed against an
  incomplete or unresolved environment.
- Builds on `lean-rs-worker-parent` / `-child` 0.1.19 (worker protocol 8), supporting the Lean toolchain window
  `4.26.0 ..= 4.31.0-rc1` (head `4.31.0-rc1`).

### Notes

- Pre-1.0: minor versions may carry breaking changes; patch releases stay compatible.
